# FireSafetyWebsite

This is a full stack web development project with database implementation that we did in our college. 
The project aims to create a website that would supply it's users with useful fire safety information and smoke detector products supplied by the major companies. The website also has a newsletter functionality that the users can register to, to get emails regarding the latest news and updates from the website.
The login and signup pages are done with MongoDB database. 
The front end is formatted with HTML5, designed with CSS and BOOTSTRAP, and made responsive using the Jacascript.
The website is hosted live on Heroku.
